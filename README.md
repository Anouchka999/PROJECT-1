# PROJECT-1/ Data Analysis
Dynamic Business Dashboard â€“ SQL & Power BI - TOYS & MODELS

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on building a dynamic business dashboard for a company that sells models and prototypes. The company already has an extensive database covering employees, products, orders, and finances. The goal is to extract and visualize key business metrics using SQL and Power BI, ensuring that the company's director receives daily updated insights for decision-making

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives & Challenge
The dashboard is structured around four key areas:
Sales â€“ Revenue tracking, product performance analysis
Finance â€“ Customer payment behavior, revenue growth
Logistics â€“ Stock management, delivery efficiency
Human Resources â€“ Employee performance, sales representative efficienc

The analysis includes mandatory KPIs (critical for business decisions), recommended KPIs (helpful for deeper insights), and optional KPIs (adding value where relevant). Creativity in proposing additional KPIs is encouraged to optimize the dashboard

ðŸ”Ž SQL Analysis â€“ KPI Computation
To build the dashboard, advanced SQL queries are written to compute business metrics, improving querying skills essential for any Data Analyst role.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

ðŸ“Œ Human Resources

ðŸ”´ Sales Performance by Employee â€“ Track revenue generated by each sales representative. <br>
ðŸŸ¢ Orders vs. Payments per Employee â€“ Detect discrepancies in transactions. <br>
ðŸŸ¢ Sales Performance by Office â€“ Compare revenue across company locations. <br>

ðŸ“Œ Sales

+ Revenue per month and per region + monthly growth rate: Track revenue generated by region and month to identify geographic trends. <br>
+ Best/worst-selling products by category: Identify the top-performing products in each category. <br>
+ Gross margin per product and category: Measure the gross margin to determine the most and least profitable products/categories. <br>
+ Monthly sales growth rate by category: Assess the performance of each product category over time. <br>
+ Average order value: Measure the average order value of purchases. <br>


ðŸ“Œ Finance

ðŸ”´ Top/Least Revenue-Generating Clients â€“ Target high-value customers. <br>
ðŸŸ¢ Debt Recovery Rate per Client â€“ Assess unpaid orders per client. <br>
âš« Quarterly Sales Growth Trends â€“ Identify seasonal patterns for forecasting. <br>

ðŸ“Œ Logistics

ðŸ”´ Stock Below Critical Threshold â€“ Prevent shortages with better inventory management. <br>
ðŸŸ¢ Average Order Processing Time â€“ Evaluate efficiency in shipping & logistics. <br>
âš« Delayed Order Delivery Rate â€“ Spot inefficiencies in delivery performance. <br>

ðŸš€ Data Processing & Optimization

Once KPIs are computed using SQL, they are optimized for Power BI visualization. <br>
ðŸ“Œ Challenge: The company's database follows a transactional schema, which is less efficient for Power BI reporting. <br>
ðŸ“Œ Solution: Data transformation into a star schema improves performance and usability within Power BI dashboards. <br>

ðŸ’» Tools & Technologies Used

 SQL (MySQL Workbench) â€“ Querying & KPI computation <br>
 Power BI â€“ Interactive dashboards & reporting <br>
 Data Modeling â€“ Star schema optimization for analytics <br>
